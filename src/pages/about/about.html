          <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
          <p>Hey there! I'm Mukul Sharma, a student at Seneca College, and I'm not the biggest game but Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) holds a special place in my heart. This website is all about my two favorite things: CS:GO and computer programming.</p>
          <img src="./images/formal-profile-picture.jpg" alt="Picture of Mukul Sharma">
          <p>So, picture this – fast-paced shooting games where split-second decisions matter a ton. That's CS:GO for you. But when I'm not playing this game, I'm deep into web development and playing around with JavaScript. It's like creating cool stuff on the internet that people can click and interact with – super fun!</p>
          <p>The idea for this website came from my childhood days playing Counter-Strike 1.6 with my cousin brother. Back then, we could only play together when I would visit him which would be once a year. Those rare gaming sessions got me hooked. When I finally got my own laptop, I jumped straight into CS:GO, and oh boy, I fell in love! Sniping, especially with the AWP, became my thing. There's something thrilling about nailing a perfect shot.</p>
          <p>This website is like my digital playground where my love for programming and CS:GO meet. I'm here to share my journey, tips on programming, and stories of epic CS:GO matches. Whether I'm talking about making cool websites or landing awesome shots, it's all about the excitement of learning and growing.</p>
          <p>Come along and join me as we explore the awesome world of CS:GO and the magic of web development. Thanks for dropping by, and I hope you have a blast checking out my website.</p>
