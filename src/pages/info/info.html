            <p class="history">
              Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a renowned first-person shooter game released in 2012. It is the latest installment in the legendary Counter-Strike franchise, which originated as a mod for Half-Life in 1999. The series evolved through various iterations, including Condition Zero and Source. CS:GO modernized the gameplay while preserving its core mechanics. With updated graphics, new maps, and an in-game economy for weapon skins, CS:GO quickly became a dominant force in esports. Regular updates and continued support from Valve ensure its enduring popularity in the gaming community.

            <h3>Competitive</h3>
            <p class="info">
              Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) offers an adrenaline-pumping competitive game mode that is at the heart of the game's global popularity. In this mode, two teams, the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists, clash in intense 5v5 matches across various maps.

              CS:GO's competitive mode combines strategic planning, precise aiming, and team coordination, making it a highly engaging experience for players.

            <h3>Casual</h3>
            <p class="info">
              Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) offers a casual game mode that provides a more relaxed and less competitive experience for players. In casual mode, teams still consist of Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, but the gameplay is more forgiving and less intense compared to the competitive mode.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
              In casual mode, players can join and leave matches at any time, allowing for a more flexible gaming experience. The matches are typically shorter and played on simplified versions of the maps, which makes it easier for newcomers to learn the basics of the game without the pressure of the competitive environment.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
              Unlike competitive mode, there is no strict team-killing penalty in casual mode, although players are encouraged to play cooperatively and support their teammates. Casual mode also offers more relaxed rules for purchasing weapons and equipment, enabling players to experiment with different strategies and playstyles.

              In deathmatch, players are pitted against each other, with no team restrictions. The objective is simple: eliminate as many opponents as possible within a given time limit. As soon as a player is eliminated, they respawn instantly, allowing for constant action and practice opportunities.
